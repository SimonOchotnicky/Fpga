# Fpga

Hi guys, in this repository you can find examples to get started with FPGA. The examples are in VHDL and Verilog. The codes are fit for Altera and Xilinx.

How to get started ? 

1. Download the Quartus or Vivado ide for FPGA programing

2. Update the driver for your fpga

3. If you want to just test the codes you need only to download a sof. files. You open sof.file in your ide. You need to change output/inputs . 
After you change input/outputs you just need to upload tho code. 

4. Later a will add complet source code to all of examples and diagrams.



The examples are : 

Examples: 
VGA examples
Buzzer 
i2C comunication
key_test
LCD test
led_Test
PS2
RS232
swith_led
USB cominacation
